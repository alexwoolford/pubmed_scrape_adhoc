# PubMed scrape (adhoc)

This is a quick & dirty scraper that collects published abstracts (PubMed ID, journal, article title, and abstract) from PubMed.

This reads the list of doctor names from `doctor_articles.txt` and writes the results to `doctor_articles.txt` in pipe-delimited format.

Here's a video walk-through of the code:
